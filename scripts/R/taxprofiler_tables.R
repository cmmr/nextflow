# taxprofiler_tables.R - Assemble the feature tables a shotgun run is delivered as.
#
# Author: Daniel Smith
# Date:   September 4th, 2026
#
# Run inside the rbiom container by taxprofiler_composition.sh, which finds
# every file named here and builds the taxonomy tree before calling this. This
# owns the files a requester loads: the profile as a BIOM with a tree in it, so
# UniFrac and Faith's PD can be computed the way they can from the 16S
# pipeline's output.
#
# Two BIOM tables are built, from the two profiles that can carry a tree at all:
#
#   feature_table/feature-table.{tsv,json.biom,hdf5.biom}
#       Bracken's species counts, keyed by NCBI taxon id, with the taxonomy
#       collapsed to seven ranks. Its tree is the NCBI taxonomy over exactly
#       those taxa with branch lengths assigned by depth - a taxonomy with
#       lengths on it rather than an inferred phylogeny, built by
#       scripts/taxprofiler_taxonomy_tree.sh. Kraken2's table is the fallback
#       for a run without Bracken, filtered to its species rows.
#
#   feature_table/metaphlan-table.hdf5.biom
#       MetaPhlAn's SGB relative abundances, on the maximum-likelihood phylogeny
#       published with that database. A real phylogeny over fewer taxa.
#
# Both trees are written out beside the tables as newick, and both go into the
# BIOM 2.1 files at observation/group-metadata/phylogeny, which is the spec's
# own place for them.
#
# Faith's PD is computed from each into the table named on the command line,
# with the abundance it was computed over beside it. taxprofiler_composition.sh
# turns that into the share of the run's reads the reading covers and publishes
# both in alpha_diversity.tsv: a phylogenetic index over a shotgun profile
# describes only the fraction of the sample that was classified, and that
# fraction is what makes it readable.
#
# count_tables/ holds the same profiles as plain matrices, one per profiler and
# unit, for a reader who wants counts rather than a BIOM:
#
#   bracken-reads.tsv, kraken2-reads.tsv
#       Reads per species. kraken2 rows below species roll up into it and rows
#       above it become one "<taxon> unclassified" species, so the table totals
#       every classified read rather than the 55% that land at species.
#
#   metaphlan-cells.tsv, metaphlan-reads.tsv
#       MetaPhlAn's own coverage and read estimates, merged from the per-sample
#       profiles that -t rel_ab_w_read_stats writes. merge_metaphlan_tables.py
#       reads only the relative abundance column, so the merged report beside
#       these two carries percentages and neither of these does.
#
#   motus-cells.tsv
#       mOTUs scaled insert counts, already per-cell: its markers are universal
#       single-copy genes, so a count is already a count of organisms.
#
# Nothing is rarefied. The read depth every index was computed at is published
# beside it, and the feature table is there to be rarefied downstream.
#
# Usage: taxprofiler_tables.R <results_dir> <faith_out> <profile_tsv>
#            <species_only> <taxonomy_tree> <lineage_tsv> <metaphlan_profile>
#            <metaphlan_tree> <metaphlan_dir> <motus_profile>
#        Every path after faith_out may be empty, which leaves out whatever
#        needed it; species_only is 1 for a kraken2 table and 0 for a bracken one
#
# Requires: rbiom (>= 3.1.0), and h5lite for the HDF5 output
