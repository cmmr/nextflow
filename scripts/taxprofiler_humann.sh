# taxprofiler_humann.sh - Functional profiling for a finished taxprofiler run.
#
# Author: Daniel Smith
# Date:   September 10th, 2026
#
# nf-core/taxprofiler answers what was in each sample and not what it could do,
# so the functional half of a shotgun deliverable is a second workflow run over
# what the first one produced. This pairs each sample with the reads that
# reached the classifiers and with its MetaPhlAn profile, then runs
# workflows/humann, which publishes <results_dir>/humann/.
#
# Two preparations happen here rather than in the workflow.
#
# The reads. taxprofiler publishes the analysis-ready set - trimmed,
# complexity-filtered, host-depleted and run-merged - under one directory, but
# names each file after the step that last touched it, so a sample's files are
# only identifiable by the sample name they start with. They are matched to the
# longest sample name they begin with, since one sample name can be a prefix of
# another.
#
# The profile. taxprofiler runs MetaPhlAn with -t rel_ab_w_read_stats, and
# HUMAnN reads the abundance out of the second-to-last column of whatever it is
# given - which in that layout is coverage, not the percentage. Handed the
# profile unchanged, HUMAnN silently reads a species at 12% as being at 0.05%
# and drops nearly everything below its prescreen threshold. So each profile is
# rewritten here into the column layout -t rel_ab writes, with the comment lines
# kept: HUMAnN 3.9 exits unless one of them names the vJun23 database.
#
# Only Illumina samples are profiled. HUMAnN's nucleotide tier is bowtie2 and
# its translated tier is DIAMOND blastx, both short-read aligners.
#
# Nothing here is fatal. A run whose functional profiling could not be done
# still publishes everything the taxonomic half produced: the entries in
# templates/taxprofiler/outputs.conf whose paths match nothing are left out, so
# the dashboard simply carries no functional section. What went wrong is
# appended to the state file's ".notes", which wrike_followup.sh reports.
#
# Usage:     taxprofiler_humann.sh [results_dir]
#            defaults to ./results, the outdir set in the taxprofiler params file
# Called by: wrike_job.sh, as a POST_PROCESS_CMDS entry of the taxprofiler
#            pipelines, before taxprofiler_upload.sh - which prunes the reads
#            this reads and then publishes what this wrote
# Requires:  nextflow (as $NEXTFLOW_DIR/bin/nextflow), apptainer, awk
# Reads:     ./taxprofiler_samplesheet.csv, <results_dir>/analysis_ready_fastqs/,
#            <results_dir>/metaphlan/, and db/humann/<release>/
# Writes:    ./humann_samplesheet.csv, ./humann_profiles/, ./humann_command.sh,
#            and <results_dir>/humann/ - the tables, the per-sample logs, and a
#            copy of that command record
# Env:       NEXTFLOW_DIR, the log/warn helpers and the run state helpers,
#            sourced from .env
