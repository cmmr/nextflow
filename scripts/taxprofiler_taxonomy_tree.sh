# taxprofiler_taxonomy_tree.sh - Build the tree a shotgun feature table is read against.
#
# Author: Daniel Smith
# Date:   September 4th, 2026
#
# A shotgun run has no sequences to build a phylogeny from - it has taxon ids.
# This writes the tree those ids imply: the NCBI taxonomy restricted to the taxa
# a run observed, collapsed to the seven ranks a profile is read at, with a
# branch length on every edge.
#
# Branch length is the reciprocal of the child's depth, so a phylum-level branch
# is 1/2 and a species-level one 1/7. That is the assignment WGSUniFrac (Wei and
# Koslicki, WABI 2022) tested UniFrac against: they replaced the fitted branch
# lengths of GTDB's bac120 tree with it and recovered the same clustering.
#
# It is a taxonomy with lengths on it, not an inferred phylogeny. What is
# computed over it is a taxonomic diversity, and the number is not comparable
# with a Faith's PD from a 16S run. scripts/R/taxprofiler_tables.R labels it as
# such wherever it publishes one.
#
# Ranks between the seven - subspecies, suborder, clade, no rank - are skipped
# rather than counted, so every lineage is measured on the same scale. A taxon
# whose lineage is missing one of the seven sits one step shallower, and its
# branch is that much longer.
#
# Only tips are labelled. An id that turns out to be an ancestor of another id
# in the same list is emitted as an internal node and is therefore not a tip;
# the caller drops it from the table rather than this inventing a place for it.
#
# The same walk writes the lineage table, one row per observed id with its
# ancestor at each of the seven ranks, named. That is the taxonomy the feature
# table carries, and it agrees with the tree by construction.
#
# Usage:     taxprofiler_taxonomy_tree.sh <taxdump_dir> <taxid_file> [lineage_tsv]
#            taxdump_dir holds nodes.dmp and names.dmp - the Kraken2 database
#            directory does; taxid_file is one NCBI taxon id per line
# Called by: scripts/R/taxprofiler_tables.R, through taxprofiler_composition.sh
# Requires:  GNU awk
# Outputs:   the tree, in newick, on stdout, and the lineage table at
#            lineage_tsv when one is named
