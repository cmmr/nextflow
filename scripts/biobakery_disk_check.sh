# biobakery_disk_check.sh - Refuse a biobakery run the disk cannot hold.

# Author: Daniel Smith

#
# Estimates the disk a biobakery run will take from the read files its
# samplesheet names, and fails before anything is staged unless both
# filesystems it writes to have that much free, or their sum when they are one:
#
#   the run directory  reads recompressed into raw-sequences/, KneadData's
#                      working space for every sample at once, and the cleaned
#                      reads KneadData leaves for the steps after it. HUMAnN
#                      works on those cleaned reads and needs less room per
#                      read than KneadData, so the same room covers it.
#   GLOBUS_DIR         the download, which holds every staged read again
#
# A file's uncompressed size is estimated from how far its first 16 MB
# decompress. Files the samplesheet step will refuse are left to it to report.
#
# Usage:     biobakery_disk_check.sh [input_samplesheet]
#            defaults to ./original_samplesheet.tsv, as downloaded by wrike_job.sh
# Called by: biobakery_samplesheet.sh, before it stages anything
# Requires:  gzip, awk, df and stat from PATH; $NEXTFLOW_DIR/bin/lbzip2 for
#            .bz2 inputs
# Env:       NEXTFLOW_DIR, GLOBUS_DIR, and the log/warn/fail helpers, sourced
#            from .env
# Outputs:   an explanation of a failure in ./run_state.json
