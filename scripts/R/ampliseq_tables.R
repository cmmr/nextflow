# ampliseq_tables.R - Assemble a run's feature table, and everything read off it.
#
# Author: Daniel Smith
# Date:   September 3rd, 2026
#
# Run inside the rbiom container by ampliseq_composition.sh, which owns the
# numbers that come from outside the feature table. This owns the feature table
# itself and everything derived from it, so the file a requester downloads and
# the numbers the Overview plots are the same object read twice.
#
# The run's ASVs are assembled from what the pipeline published - the counts and
# sequences as its last filter left them, DADA2's taxonomy, and the phylogeny
# EPA-NG placed them on - into one rbiom object. as_rbiom() takes those files as
# they are and matches them up by the identifiers each one carries, so nothing
# here reorders one table against another.
#
# That object is then written out three ways, and summarised two ways:
#
#   feature_table/feature-sequences.fasta   the sequences of exactly those ASVs
#   feature_table/excluded_asvs.tsv         what exclude_taxa removed, and why
#   feature_table/feature-table.tsv         counts and taxonomy, classic tabular
#   feature_table/feature-table.json.biom   BIOM 1.0
#   feature_table/feature-table.hdf5.biom   BIOM 2.1, and the only one of the
#                                           three that carries the tree - the
#                                           spec's own place for it is
#                                           observation/group-metadata/phylogeny
#   abundance_tables/L<n>-<rank>-counts.tsv     counts collapsed to each rank
#   abundance_tables/L<n>-<rank>-relative.tsv   the same as sample shares
#   alpha_diversity.tsv                     per-sample diversity, unrarefied,
#                                           every index rbiom offers that a
#                                           denoised table supports
#   <plot data>                             what the Overview's charts draw
#   <statistics>                            counts for the Overview's sidebar
#
# Every rank is collapsed by rbiom's own taxa_matrix(). The published tables
# take unc = "grouped", which names an ASV the classifier stopped short on for
# the deepest rank it did reach, so every ASV has a row at every rank; the chart
# takes unc = "drop", so it draws what was found and a column stands short of
# the whole sample by what was not.
#
# Taxa named in exclude_taxa are dropped before any of that, so every file here
# describes the same set of ASVs. The match is a case-insensitive substring
# against the whole lineage, which is what QIIME 2's own filter did before this
# replaced it.
#
# Nothing is rarefied. These runs have no experimental grouping to compare, and
# a delivery platform is the wrong place to decide a sampling depth on a
# requester's behalf. The read depth every index was computed at is published
# beside it, and the feature table is there to be rarefied downstream.
#
# Usage: ampliseq_tables.R <results_dir> <plot_data.json> <statistics.tsv>
#            [exclude_taxa] [method]
#        exclude_taxa is a comma-separated list, or "none"; method is the
#        sentence the composition chart is captioned with, or empty
#
# Requires: rbiom (>= 3.1.0), and h5lite for the HDF5 output

# One row per taxon, one column per sample, at one rank. Both the tables and the

# ASV the classifier stopped short on:
#
#   unc = "grouped"  names it for the deepest rank it did reach - "Unc.
#                    Bacillota" at genus for one placed no further than its
#                    phylum - so every ASV has a row at every rank. This is what
#                    the published tables collapse with: a table that quietly
#                    dropped rows would not add up to the feature table beside
#                    it.
#
#   unc = "drop"     leaves it out. This is what the chart draws: a band is a
#                    taxon that was actually found, and a column falls short of
#                    the whole sample by exactly what was not. rbiom counts
#                    "uncultured" and "incertae sedis" as unreached here, which
#                    is what they are.
#
# transform = "percent" takes each share against the sample's whole read total
# before either of those runs, so dropping a taxon does not redistribute it.

# What sits above a drawn name, for the line under it in the legend. taxa_map()
# groups the ASVs exactly as taxa_matrix() does, so the two agree on what a row
# is called; asking it for the lineage as well gives the path, and the taxon's
